Remaining mechanics to be done/finished: <br>

- [ ] class mechanic:
eletctric engine inventory item with charge. restores 0.5 stamina per second
made from the light boxes from golems, abilities may increase drain of energy from this item
drains passively during combat, recharges passively out of combat each second, has around 200 charge

- [ ] UI for the engine charge
- [ ] if the engine is at 70% charge or higher gain Energized buff untill it drops under 70%
once it falls below 30% gain drawback until it goes back

pre breakthrough-
- [x] choise between passive: more physical/more electric focus, schyter/ purifier, choise affects abilities<br>
	Scyther- increases physical damage, decreases physical resistance<br>
	Purifier- increases lightning damage, decreases decay resistance<br>


- [ ] draw attack, teleport- deals either confusion or doom depending on focus


- [ ] jump-over: use your target as a ramp to leap over them, build up confusion/doomed

- [ ] Sword column- dodge roll now builds up blessed(purifier) or on player, costs 5 more stamina, if user already has blessed, recharges Engine by 8 with every dodge

Breakthrough passive-
- [ ] 1) engine now gives 5 max health and stamina, uses mana to restore 2 burnt stamina and 1 burnt health per second, gives 0.75 more stamina per second
or
- [ ] 2) engine now gives 15 max stamina and every time skill cooldown is reset (through prime or break buff) skills cost is also refunded, restores 0.25 per second

- [ ] both breakthroughs cause break buff to build up on the player in combat, some skills spend it to have additional effects
	add build up of Charged on engine UI

post breakthrough-

- [ ] Lightning dash- dash through the target and deal damage if has a break-buff refresh cooldown, if prime was active will not use up break buff
requires Bless

- [ ] Overclock-imbue- Scyther- each hit triggers aditional strikes, Purifier-builds up AoE electric dot that chains on nearby enemies and spreads
posssibly gives some weapons different animations during use<br>
Requires Bless<br>
or<br>
- [ ] Blade storm- Scyther- imobilize enemies, strike multiple times and then apear behind them, Purifier- immobilize enemies and strike them with lightning strike <br>
Requires Bless
<br>

<br>
these are for dual weilding later:<br>

- [ ] Sword column- split sword into 2 Varian style, no imbues usable other than Hermit or electric during this

- [ ] Sword column-Blade execution- requires split sword, damage type depends on focus, 2x damage if break buff was used, gives killstreak if kills target
