Remaining mechanics to be done/finished: <br>

- [ ] class mechanic:
eletctric engine inventory item with charge. restores 0.5 stamina per second
made from the light boxes from golems, abilities may increase drain of energy from this item 
drains passively during combat, recharges passively out of combat each second, has around 200 charge 

- [ ] UI for the engine charge
- [ ] if the engine is at 70% charge or higher gain Energized buff untill it drops under 70%,
once it falls below 30% gain drawback until it goes back

pre breakthrough-
- [ ] choise between passive: more physical/more electric focus, schyter/ purifier, choise affects abilities<br>
	Scyther- increases physical damage, decreases physical resistance<br>
	Purifier- increases lightning damage, decreases decay resistance<br>
	works only when engine is active

- [ ] dodge roll now builds up blessed on player, costs 5 more stamina, if user already has blessed, recharges Engine by 6 with every dodge

Breakthrough passive-
- [ ] 1) engine now gives 5 max health and stamina, uses mana to restore 2 burnt stamina and 1 burnt health per second, gives 0.75 more stamina per second
or
- [ ] 2) engine now gives 15 max stamina and every time skill cooldown is reset (through prime or break buff) skills cost is also refunded, restores 0.25 more stamina per second

- [ ] both breakthroughs cause Charged buff to build up on the player in combat, some skills spend it to have additional effects
	add build up of Charged on engine UI

post breakthrough-<br>


- [ ] a way for Lightning dash, quickdraw and Jump-over to trigger on dodge effects (build up bless/charge engine, decrease Permafrost stacks if Vanguard is installed etc.)

- [ ] Overclock doubles the energy consumtion, would be active until  the fight ends or you run out of energy and would restore 20 energy for each death around player
right now it has fixed duration
- [ ] Bladestorm would eat 50 energy, but would refund 12 for each kill
